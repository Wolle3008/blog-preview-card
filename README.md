## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned the use of the :has pseudo-selector 
```css
.container:has(h1:hover) {
    box-shadow: 16px 16px;
}
```
to change some properties on elements when hovering some other element.

### Useful resources

- [How to use :has pseudo-selector](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8114657/how-to-style-the-parent-element-when-hovering-a-child-element) - This helped me to understand how change the box-shadow of the whole container while hovering only one element in it.
